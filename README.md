# Dynamic Pathing, Asset management, and COA Plans for Multidisciplinary United States Air Force Operations 
## Project Description

- A simulation-based research project focused on autonomous and operator-assisted multi-agent path planning in dynamic environments.
- Initial mission scenarios include search and rescue and disaster response.

## Major Technologies to be Used:

1. Visual Studio Code (IDE)
2. Python (Programming Lanuage)
3. Pytest (Python Library for Unit Tests)

## Long Term Project Goals:

1. Build a simulation to test the specified operations.
2. Develop autonomous, collaborative agents and strategies for these operations.

## Immediate Progress Plan:
- [ ] Have an online meeting with our mentor
- [ ] Make a final decision on a programming language and the technologies to be used
- [ ] Agreement on code practices, version control, CI/CD elements, etc
- [ ] Baseline algorithms and graphical elements
